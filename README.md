# S-boxes based on Orthogonal Cellular Automata

GitHub repository for the source code and the experimental data of the paper: 

L. Manzoni, L. Mariot: On the Linear Components Space of S-boxes Generated by Orthogonal Cellular Automata. Submitted to ACRI 2022. Preprint available at: (currently submitting it to arXiv)

Compiling
---------
To compile the code, just run javac *.java from inside the directory src/

Running
-------
The two main classes that can be run are the following ones:

* TestGenerateOCAList: Generate the list of nonlinear OCA pairs by performing an exhaustive search over all pairs of bipermutive local rules of diameter d
* TestOCASBoxFile: Given a text file containing the Wolfram codes of pairs of nonlinear bipermutive local rules of diameter d generating OCA (one line of text per pair), construct the corresponding S-boxes and compute their nonlinearity and linear component space (LCS)     

### Examples:

```
$ java TestGenerateOCAList 4 0 256
```

Generate the set of nonlinear OCA pairs of diameter 4. The output of the program cannot be directly fed to TestOCASBoxFile: to obtain a suitable input file, you need to filter out the output of TestGenerateOCAList with a command like this:

```
$ java TestGenerateOCAList 4 0 256 | awk '{print $3 " " $10}' >> testls_d4_nl4.txt
```

Then, the file testls_d4_nl4.txt can be fed to TestOCASboxFile as follows:

```
$ java TestOCASboxFile testls_d4.nl4.txt 4
```

This will reproduce the output in the file data/test_ocasboxes_d4_nl4.txt
